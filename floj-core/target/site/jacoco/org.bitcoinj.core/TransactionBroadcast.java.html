/**
 * Represents a single transaction broadcast that we are performing. A broadcast occurs after a new transaction is created
 * (typically by a {@link Wallet} and needs to be sent to the network. A broadcast can succeed or fail. A success is
 * defined as seeing the transaction be announced by peers via inv messages, thus indicating their acceptance. A failure
 * is defined as not reaching acceptance within a timeout period, or getting an explicit reject message from a peer
 * indicating that the transaction was not acceptable.
